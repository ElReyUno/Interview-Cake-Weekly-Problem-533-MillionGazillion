This project focuses on trim down the amount of space taken up by web pages visited by the crawler. It is implemented in JavaScript and includes unit tests using Jest.

## Objectives
- Implement an algorithm to reduce the memory usage of visited set.
  - Consider Big Order (Big O) Notation for Time Complexity.
   - Will test a Bloom Filter and storing Hashes instead of URLs.
- Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the algorithm.

## From Interview Cake
I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.

Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents' basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of memory because visited is getting so huge.

How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?

## Tools and Technologies
- JavaScript
  - Conversion to Typescript in future project
- Jest (for unit testing)
- Node.js
- Node.js CI
- Babel
- Git Bash
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code

## How to Run the Tests
npm (Node Package Manager) and yarn are both package managers for JavaScript. I will be using npm however either will suffice.

In utilizing the Test-Driven Development (TDD) software development process I will be writing the test to initially fail (red) which will pass (green) once the minimum code to pass the test is written and then the code will be refactored to improve design and structure. The cycle of "Red-Green-Refactor" is repeated for each new feature or piece of functionality.

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
   - Download and install from https://nodejs.org/
   - Verify installation:
     - `node -v`
     - `npm -v`
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Install Jest by running `npm install --save-dev jest`.
   - This creates package.json. Ensure this file includes a test script to run Jest.
4. Run the tests by executing `npm test` from the parent directory of the test file.

## Pretty Print Test Results
To pretty print the test results, you can use the `prettyPrintJson.js` script. This script reads the `test-results.json` file generated by Jest and outputs a formatted version to `pretty-test-results.json`.

1. Ensure you have run the tests and generated the `test-results.json` file.
2. Execute the script by running:
